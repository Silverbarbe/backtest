Personal Journey & Vision for AI: 

This project marks my first foray into the world of programming. While it has been an enlightening journey, I'd like to acknowledge the assistance of ChatGPT in co-writing and refining the code. Their insights and guidance have been invaluable in bringing this project to life. I firmly believe in the transformative potential of AI as personal assistants. The collaboration with ChatGPT has only strengthened that belief, showcasing how limitless the possibilities truly are. As technology continues to evolve, I envision a future where AI seamlessly integrates into our daily lives, amplifying our capabilities and fostering innovation.
